## 
Bob & Carol made competing line changes that contradict Ted & Alice lines in the FUBAR.md file. Since they made different changes to the same line of the same files on different branches in the team’s Git repository.  During the merge request, we deleted the conflicting lines annotated with the markers ‘’’<<<<<<<’’’, ‘’’=======’’’, ‘’’>>>>>>>’’’ and reviewed the we wanted to commit in the final merge.

To prevent merge conflicts, be sure to communicate with team members to let each other know what the other person is working on.
We can use a git diff,  git stash and git pop commands are also useful.
